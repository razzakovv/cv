#### briefly about myself

Having started my career as a layout designer in a local newspaper with minimum skills, I became profficient in printing design. My keen interest in printing technologies led me to working as a Prepress and DTP Engineer in the largest printing house in my city,
where I continued self-learning, examining the process of creating wine and food labels, magazines and other printed goods.
